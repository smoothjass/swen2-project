Lorenz Duelli's &amp; Jasmin Duvivi√©'s SWEN2 project at UASTW

The following grey part is old information and not applicable anymore: <br>
<span style="color:grey">Lorenz and Jassi branches serve the purpose to be able to complete the mini self-study tasks independently of each other.
If we like one of our self-study solutions enough, we will merge it into our main project. Otherwise, we will implement
a new solution together.</span> <br>
With some input from our lecturer we decided to keep our main branch but delete the person branches. Instead we will
create feature branches. These will be merged into main and deleted as soon as the funcionality is finished. This should
reduce merge conflicts by shortening the lifetime of non-main branches to a necessary minimum.
